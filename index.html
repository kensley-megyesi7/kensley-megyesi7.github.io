            This is my website and there's many interesting things to learn. Some are personal and general information. This includes the career I want to work towards.
        </p>
        <p> I'm a sophomore in high school and when I get out of college I want to be a Police Officer, Artist, Multilingual, or Therapist. I will pursue a different career if these things don't work out.</p>
